# Neuron (In development)
-----------------------------------------------
**Neuron** is a IOTs platform designed to expose a collection of devices, sensors and actuators in a standard format to downstream applications. The platform handles device registration, device activity management, bi-directional device communication and exposes them over a RESTful API.

The project is a M2e (Maven to Eclipse) project and is distributed amongst several modular (although interdependent) jar files.

###Features:
* Device management
* Device, sensor and actuator discovery
* Remote access to sensor and actuator functionality and data
* Dynamic device filtration (No stale devices)

###Future features:
* (Asynchronous) Sensor data streaming using server sent events
* Management interface
* ...
